# Axion-like Early Dark Energy Model

This repository hosts materials for the research article "Axion-like Early Dark Energy: A Unified Solution to the Hubble Tension and Cosmic Acceleration," addressing cosmology’s Hubble tension (H₀ = 72.4 ± 1.0 km/s/Mpc) and cosmic acceleration using an ultralight axion-like particle (phi) as Early Dark Energy (EDE). It also resolves the S₈ tension via a novel dark matter interaction.

## Overview
The model predicts:
- Hubble constant (H₀) raised to 72.4 ± 1.0 km/s/Mpc, bridging early (CMB) and late (supernovae) measurements.
- S₈ tension eased by 10% through phi’s interaction with dark matter.
- Late-time cosmic acceleration (w_EDE = -0.98 ± 0.02).
- Testable signals: 15% CMB polarization drop (CMB-S4), 10⁻¹⁵ Hz gravitational waves (LISA), and 30% 21-cm absorption boost (SKA-LOW/HERA).

## Contents
- `code class_EDE.docx`: Placeholder documentation for the CLASS-based EDE simulator, describing phi’s parameters and H₀ calculation.
- `results.docx`: Placeholder summary of simulation results, including H₀, sound horizon reduction (5%), and w_EDE outputs.

## Usage
- Download or clone this repo to access files.
- Open `code class_EDE.docx` and `results.docx` with Microsoft Word or a compatible viewer to review the EDE model details and outputs.
- Note: These are placeholder files—real code (e.g., `class_EDE.py`) and data (e.g., `ede_simulation_results.txt`) will be added later to replace these documents.

## Article Reference
See the full article draft (planned for `docs/article.md`) or contact the author for more details.

## Future Updates
Real code, data outputs, and organized folders (`code/`, `data/`) will follow, enhancing transparency for *Nature* submission. Expect Python scripts (`class_EDE.py`), simulation data (`minicluster_data.csv`), and MCMC fits (`mcmc_results.csv`).
